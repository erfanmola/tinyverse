# Tinyverse

Sometimes I miss the good old screensaver days. I also miss the interstellar music. And since I’m a fan of minimalism, here’s all of them combined: a <30KB space screensaver with interstellar music to relax and chill.

**Note:** You’ll need to interact with the page to start the music and get things playing.
